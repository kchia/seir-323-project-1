# seir-323-project-1

## Description

My first project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive was to build a game. I chose to build a trivia game because I love trivia and thought it would be fun to test people's knowledge in a variety of different categories.

You can use this trivia game to have fun and test your own knowledge, or build upon what I created (adding more questions, functionality, design, etc.).

The problem this project solves is that a lot of trivia games usually focus on one topic. I wanted to give my users a chance to shine in their preferred category or have them see how far they could go in a subject they are not too familiar with.
